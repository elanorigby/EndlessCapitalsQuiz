# Endless Capitals Quiz
True, it quizes you on both countries and capitals, but Endless Countries and Capitals Quiz is just too darn long.

## Three modes
1) Guess the capital by the country
2) Guess the country by the capital
3) Random (not yet implemented)


### Plans
This is currently a prototype that runs in the Python Shell, but I intend to slap a flask app onto it and host it on pythonanywhere.

And eventually, maybe, maybe make it an Android app so my auntie can use it on her phone.
